# credit-card-offers
A list of current credit card sign up bonuses. Updated roughly every three months. If you want an **always-updated version** where most bonuses are regularly checked via web scraping, and that comes with tons of other useful filters out of the box, check out **[Offer Optimist](https://offeroptimist.com)**, which this data is pulled directly from. A premium subscription ($2/mo) allows you to download an always-updated version of this .csv file.

Here's a direct link to the file, if you're on mobile or not used to GitHub: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endwise/credit-card-bonuses/main/credit-card-bonuses.csv
